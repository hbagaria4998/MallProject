<p>1. People with high annual icnome and high spending score, they are the target that we want to focus most on, as they can afford costly products and they are interested in buying from us.</p><br>
<p>2. People with low income but with high spending score, in our dataset, they are a minority, but they would like low price products as they can afford them and it is clear that if they spend so much in our mall even with low income, they are likely to come back to us. The advertisement focus for them should be less but should alert them of products which are low priced and provide good value.</p><br>
<p>3. People with low earning and low spending score, they are not a big target audience for us. But we can increasse their spending score by offering low price products and attractive discounts.</p><br>
<p>4. People we should least focus on as they don't buy from us even if they can afford it.</p><br>
<p>5. People with average income and average spending score. They need to be retained, as they dont spend a huge ammount they would probably be attracted a lot by discounts and offers catered to them. Also this is the largest segment of the customers, so we should concentrate to increase their retentivity and spending score. </p><br>
